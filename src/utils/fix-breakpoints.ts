/**
 * This is a utility type to correctly handle breakpoints throughout the application
 * Any component that compares breakpoint directly to a string value should use this pattern:
 * 
 * Before:
 *   const breakpoint = useBreakpoint();
 *   if (breakpoint === "mobile") { ... }
 * 
 * After ONE of these:
 *   1. Use isBreakpoint() utility:
 *      const breakpointState = useBreakpoint();
 *      if (isBreakpoint(breakpointState, "mobile")) { ... }
 * 
 *   2. Destructure properly:
 *      const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint();
 *      if (breakpoint === "mobile") { ... }
 * 
 *   3. Use convenience hooks:
 *      const isMobile = useIsMobileBreakpoint();
 *      if (isMobile) { ... }
 * 
 * This ensures correct TypeScript typing
